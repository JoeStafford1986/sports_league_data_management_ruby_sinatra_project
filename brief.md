Sports Scoring app
Build an app that let's a sportsfan keep track of their favourite sports league.

MVP:
The app should allow the user create, edit and delete teams to the league
The user should be able to create, edit and delete games
There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
The app should display if a game was won or lost
Inspired by
Sky Sports, BBC Sports

Possible Extensions:
Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
You might not want/need to create a table in the database for this, but just use Ruby logic in the models to calculate each teams points etc, based on the results of games
Add players to teams and let them have game stats (points won, fouls, etc.)
Anything else you can think of
